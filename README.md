<h1> Paper to Code </h2>


<h2> Introduction </h4>


Paper to Code bridges the gap between research and implementation, enabling you to easily integrate cutting-edge techniques from academic papers into your code. Powered by OpenAI's GPT models, it automatically extracts core concepts and applies them to your codebase.


<h2> How It Works </h4>

Here's a concise overview of the project's workflow:

**Extract Relevant Text**: The code directly extracts key sections (e.g., Introduction, Methodology) from the paper's URL, eliminating downloads and streamlining the process.

**Refine Content**: Unnecessary elements like reference marks and URLs are removed, ensuring focus on core concepts.

**Summarize with GPT**: OpenAI's GPT model summarizes the refined text, condensing key concepts for seamless integration.

**Integrate into Code**: The GPT model then merges the summarized concepts into your existing Python code, resulting in a new version that incorporates the paper's approach.

**Save for Future Use**: The integrated code is saved as a separate file, preserving the paper's methodology for future projects.


<h2> Project Application </h4>

To integrate the approach into your python project, use the [main.py](test/main.py) file as a base. As an example, this repository has two folders that show different applications from this project:

[cyclical-learning-rates](test/cyclical-learning-rates): Within this folder, the "Cyclical Learning Rates" approach is applied to a TensorFlow-based model trained on the MNIST dataset.

[layer normalization](test/layer-normalization): Within this folder, the "Layer Normalization" approach is applied to a model that is slightly different. This difference was strategically created to facilitate the application of the paper.

Note: AI understanding is reinforced by well-documented code, facilitating effective decision-making during onboarding. Not only that, it is important to note that this project uses articles that propose simple concepts, as complex mathematical content or computer vision-oriented content can be difficult for AI to understand.


<h2> Choosing GPT model </h4>

Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 produce similar results, but GPT-3.5 is the more cost-effective choice. Each code generated costs less than an eighth of a dollar and is produced in less than two minutes. To save money, a free alternative would be to use the prompts from the [paper_to_code.py](src/paper_to_code.py) file in ChatGPT. However, this method requires manual intervention and is not automatic.


<h2> Error Considerations </h4>

Although the final code might occasionally contain errors, these are usually confined to a single line. Most IDEs will readily highlight these errors, making them simple to fix.
